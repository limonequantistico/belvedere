# Belvedere (Alternative names: Vistas, FYE - Follow Your Earth)

## Vision
A serene, beautifully designed discovery app dedicated exclusively to finding and sharing the world's best panoramic viewpoints. It connects scenic locations with rich social content, making it effortless to find hidden gems—from local hilltops to secret city rooftops—without the clutter of traditional navigation apps.

## User Personas
- **The Local Explorer (Alex, 24, Content Creator):** Always looking for aesthetic spots for photography or just to chill. Main pain point: general map apps don't filter for "scenic beauty." Looking for curated, visually appealing locations. Hobbies: hiking, photography, social media.
- **The Aesthetic Traveler (Sofia, 32, Designer):** Loves visiting new cities but wants to avoid generic tourist traps. Main pain point: finding breathtaking views requires extensive research. Looking for quick, reliable suggestions with real visual proof. Hobbies: travel, food, culture.

## Core Features
1. **Themed Interactive Map:** A custom, open-source map with a unique, relaxing aesthetic (e.g., stylized, cartoonish, or RPG-like elements) and custom AI-generated POI markers.
2. **Geolocation & Viewpoint Discovery:** Instantly see curated panoramic spots around your current location.
3. **Rich Content Sheets:** Tapping a POI opens a sliding sheet containing exclusive video content and practical info (how to get there, what you will see).
4. **Social Media Ecosystem:** Seamlessly ties in with a dedicated social channel (TikTok/Reels) to feature places and drive traffic to the app.
5. **Community Submissions:** A crowdsourced feature where users can suggest new viewpoints to be verified and added to the official map.

## Non-Goals
- Turn-by-turn navigation (users will be comfortably redirected to Google Maps/Waze).
- Comprehensive business listings (places are included strictly for their view, not their menu or service).
- Replacing standard utility maps.

## High-level Concept
It's Atlas Obscura meets TikTok, but built entirely around breathtaking panoramic views and mapped with the charm of an exploration video game.

## Existing Alternatives
- **Google Maps / Apple Maps:** Great for navigation, but terrible for filtering specifically by "scenic beauty" and lacks rich visual storytelling.
- **TripAdvisor / Yelp:** Focuses heavily on standard businesses and reviews rather than natural, hidden, or purely aesthetic spots.
- **Instagram / TikTok:** Excellent for discovering places, but terrible for organizing them geographically or finding them nearby on a map.

## Unique Value Proposition
Belvedere turns finding beautiful views into an aesthetic experience itself. Unlike traditional maps that show everything, we offer a highly curated, visually unique map paired with rich video content, ensuring you know exactly what the panorama looks like before you even arrive.
